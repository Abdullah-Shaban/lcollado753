## Load data
load("../data/fell.Rdata")

### Simple EDA

## Data over time
plot(fell$date, fell$visits, col=ifelse(fell$post, "blue", "orange"))
tapply(fell$visit, fell$post, mean)

## Some "FALSE" have high number of visits. Possibly carrying over from a post the day before.
boxplot(fell$visit ~ fell$post)

## Diff in means in significant
t.test(fell$visit ~ fell$post)

## Not normal looking
qqnorm(fell$visit[fell$post])
qqnorm(fell$visit[!fell$post])

## Lets compare days of the post and 2 days after vs rest
postDays <- function(df, day) {
	days <- df$date[df$post]
	new <- sapply(2:day, function(x) { days + x}, simplify=FALSE)
	all <- sort(c(days, do.call(c, new)))
	add <- data.frame(df$date %in% all)
	colnames(add) <- paste0("post", day)
	cbind(df, add)
}
## Marc days with posts (and the day after too)
fell2 <- postDays(fell, 2)

## View data
plot(fell2$date, fell2$visits, col=ifelse(fell2$post2, "blue", "orange"))

## Visits are still different
boxplot(fell2$visit ~ fell2$post2)

## Smaller difference than when comparing vs day of the post (see previous t.test)
t.test(fell2$visit ~ fell2$post2)

## Looks very similar for non post days vs also excluding day after post
boxplot(fell$visit[!fell$post], fell2$visit[!fell2$post2])

## No significant diff in the mean for all non post days vs also excluding day after post
t.test(fell$visit[!fell$post], fell2$visit[!fell2$post2])
